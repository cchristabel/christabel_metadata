# Metadata
# Project Description
## Objective
The project involved creating a system capable of:
- Accepting various file types, such as photos, PDFs, audio files, and potentially Office documents.
- Extracting metadata from these files and storing it in a database.
- Allowing users to search for files through a web-based interface using the metadata as search criteria.
- Providing search results that enabled users to view or download the files directly.

### Key Components
1. File Ingestion and Metadata Extraction:
The system was designed to handle multiple file types, including images, PDF documents, audio files, and Office documents.
Metadata, such as file name, creation date, file size, and other specific details, was extracted automatically and stored in the database.

2. Database:
A database was implemented to store all extracted metadata.
The database was structured to allow efficient querying based on various metadata attributes.

3. Web-Based Search Interface:
A user-friendly, web-based interface was developed to enable users to search for files.
Users could search by criteria such as file type, creation date, keywords, or other metadata fields.

4. Search Results and File Access:
The system displayed search results with details about each file (e.g., file name, type, and metadata).
Users could either preview the files (e.g., viewing images or PDFs) or download them directly from the interface.

### Outcome
The final system provided an efficient and intuitive solution for managing, searching, and accessing files based on their metadata. 
It combined automated metadata extraction with a robust search functionality, offering a seamless experience for end users.
